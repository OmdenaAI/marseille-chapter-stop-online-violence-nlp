# Data

Please upload all collected data in the `raw_data` directory. If necessary, create subdirectories.

The annotated data will have to be uploaded in the `annotated_data` directory. Create subdirectories if necessary.

All annotators are required to register their intention to work on a file/subfile in the `annotation_info.txt` file.

The labels to be used are:
- racism;
- sexism;
- homophobia;
- hate speech;
- bullying.

'None' can be used for examples that not suitable for our needs.

Use the `ambiguous_occurrences.csv` file within the `annotated_data/` directory for occurrences that you are unable to label. Please suggest 1/2 labels that you think might be suitable for the example in question. Another annotator will confirm/modify these at a later stage.
